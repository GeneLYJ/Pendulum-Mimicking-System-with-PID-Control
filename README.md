The aims of the assignment of real time pendulum mimicking
system are:
  1. Develop and design a real time embedded system with
     the knowledge of programming, understanding,
     technique and concept of RTOS from lectures and labs.
     
  2. Understands the trade-off between hardware and
     software implementation in a real time embedded
     system by studying the software hardware co-design
     problem.
     
  3. Convert the timing information from photoelectric
     sensor and quadrature encoder and its relationship from
     programming to real time pendulum mimicking system.
  4. Design a module that responds deterministically to the
     sensor interrupts within hard deadlines.
     
  5. Design a PID controller on the difference of quadrature
     encoder position to the origin to determine the required
     PWM and the period of oscillation to mimic the
     pendulum system accurately to the real pendulum in
     real time.
